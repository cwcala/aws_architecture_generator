enterprise carbon footprint calculator architecture. 3 tier AWS architecture starts with presentation tier where users access the application through Cloudfront's global CDN, protected by WAF and Shield, with Route 53 managing DNS. Web and mobile frontend assets are stored in S3. Application tier handles business logic through containerized services running on ECS/Fargate, with API Gateway managing API requests and Cognito handling authentication. Asynchronous processing is managed through Eventbridge, SQS, and Lambda functions. Data tier uses Aurora PostgreSQL for primary data storage, Redis caching for performance optimization, and Dynamodb for real-time metrics. Data analytics through a pipeline using Kinesis for data streaming, processed by EMR and Athena, results visualized in Quicksight dashboards. Monitoring by Cloudwatch and secured through IAM and KMS encryption, with auto-scaling across multiple availability zones for high availability and performance.
