Aws application architecture diagram generator application 

This web application allows CTO users to generate professional AWS architecture diagrams by simply describing their architecture in natural language.  n

## Architecture Components:

1. **Amazon Route 53**: Provides DNS routing to the application.

2. **Amazon CloudFront**: Delivers the web application content with low latency.

3. **Amazon S3**: Hosts the static frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

4. **AWS Lambda**: Processes user requests and orchestrates the diagram generation workflow.

5. **Amazon API Gateway**: Creates RESTful API endpoints that connect the frontend to Lambda functions.

6. **Amazon Bedrock**: Processes natural language descriptions and generates Python code using Claude 3 Opus or Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet.

7. **Amazon SageMaker with Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet Provides additional LLM capabilities for complex diagram generation.

8. **AWS Lambda (Execution Environment)**: Executes the generated Python code using the Diagrams library to create the architecture diagram.

9. **Amazon S3 (Output Bucket)**: Stores the generated diagram images.

10. **Amazon DynamoDB**: Stores user sessions and diagram history.

11. **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors application performance and logs.

##Data Flow:

1. Users access the application through CloudFront, which serves content from S3.
2. When a CTO submits an architecture description, API Gateway routes the request to Lambda.
3. Lambda calls Amazon Bedrock to process the natural language and generate Python code using the Diagrams library.
4. For complex requests, Nova Pro on SageMaker may be used for enhanced code generation.
5. The generated code is executed in a Lambda environment with the Diagrams library.
6. The resulting diagram is stored in S3 and returned to the user.
7. User session data and diagram history are stored in DynamoDB.

This architecture provides a serverless, scalable solution that leverages AWS's AI services to transform natural language descriptions into professional architecture diagrams
